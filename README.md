This project calculates the Levenshtein distance which measures how many edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) are needed to turn one string into another using dynamic programming.
This code cleans a sentence by converting it to lowercase, extracting only alphabetic words, removing stop words, and reducing some words to their base form before returning the final list.
This code checks a message by converting it to lowercase and seeing if it contains any predefined spam words, then labels it as spam or not spam.
This code prepares text for sentiment analysis by lowercasing it, removing hashtags and special characters, splitting it into words, and filtering out common stop words before returning the cleaned list.
This code compares a typed word with the correct word using two methods: standard Levenshtein distance and a keyboard-aware weighted distance. It shows how considering nearby keyboard keys can improve spelling correction decisions.
